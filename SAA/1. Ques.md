Ques 1. A company wants to migrate their onprims application to aws. They have webapplication, batch processing and legacy applications and they want highly scalable,secure and batch processing

### Ans:
	#### Web application (legacy application): 
		- deploy in Ec2 instances along with autoscaling group in multi AZ region
		- Implement ACL and security group for improving the security
	#### Batch processing:
		- Go with cost effective way of AWS batch 

  - High availability and fault tolerance for web applications.
  - Cost-effective and scalable solutions for batch processing.
  - A secure and isolated environment for legacy applications.

### Which architecture would you recommend?

A. Web applications in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones, AWS Batch for batch processing, and legacy applications on Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet with Network ACLs and Security Groups.

B. Amazon ECS for web applications, AWS Lambda for batch processing, and Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet for legacy applications.

C. Amazon EKS for web applications, AWS Glue for batch processing, and Amazon EC2 instances in a private subnet with Network ACLs and Security Groups for legacy applications.

D. Amazon EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancer for web applications, AWS Batch for batch processing, and legacy applications on Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet with Security Groups.

### Evaluate each option:

A. Correct. Ensures high availability, scalability, and security.

B. Incorrect. AWS Lambda may not be cost-effective for long-running tasks, and a public subnet for legacy applications is not secure.

C. Incorrect. AWS Glue is not ideal for batch processing, though the security setup for legacy applications is correct.

D. Incorrect. A public subnet for legacy applications is insecure without Network ACLs, despite providing high availability for web applications."
