A company is planning to shutdown for 2 weeks and during this they want to reduce the cost on running the instances, but those ec2 instances are storing the data in the instances memory there is no ebs memory attchaded into the ec2 instances since the data is soring in the instance memrory they want to same data to be available when they back to resume their operation.
what would be your strategy to save the cost?

### Ans: 
    #### In this case we can go with the enabled hibernate option for your ec2 instances. 



#### When your instance is started after hibernation:

- The EBS root volume is restored to its previous state

- The RAM contents are reloaded

- The processes that were previously running on the instance are resumed

- Previously attached data volumes are reattached and the instance retains its instance ID

  #### Note:
  - You're not charged for instance usage for a hibernated instance
  - You are charged for storage of any EBS volumes
  - including storage for the RAM contents
